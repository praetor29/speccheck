# B2Twin-Hackathon

B2Twin Hackathon March 22 & 23, 2025

## Introduction

Biosphere 2, a research facility unlike any other in the world, stands as a testament to our quest for understanding Earth's intricate and intelligent ecosystems. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller's "Spaceship Earth", it is the worldâ€™s largest controlled environment dedicated to unraveling the complexities of our planet. Now, by harnessing the awesome potential of Artificial Intelligence and the ingenuity of young engineers drawn to this university, we are poised to elevate our comprehension of these living systems to unprecedented, super-intelligent levels. This exciting collaboration marks a pathway into the future, where together we will deepen our knowledge of Earth's stewardship and even explore the possibilities of off-planet living.

B2Twin is the brand name for a new AI / XR system development strategy from Biosphere 2 and AI Core. Your goal as a hacker is to innovate ways to create a digital twin of Biosphere 2 that will help scientists restore degraded environments on earth and prepare for space travel.

### Stage 1: get LLM running on local machine
### Stage 2: grab starter data from GitHub and learn to make them usable by your LLM
### Stage 3: connect to comprehensive data archive for access to all data and do something useful with it
### Stage 4: get your LLMs to talk to each other and work together to do science 

- Begin by installing an appropriately sized AI model (on average 7b parameters or less) on your device using Ollama: https://ollama.com/
- Help any other teams struggling with step 1 and win prize tokens before moving on
- Make use of LLMs offered through AI Core to get programming help from Claude Sonnet 3.7 and other AI models: Go to https://chat.aicore.arizona.edu/ and sign up. The AI Core Team will approve the request.

- Download these Biosphere 2 sensor data .csv files from GitHub/Google Drive: We will provide the link to the files on the day of the Hackathon

- Create your own code folder and store your code files in this GitHub repository: This will be provided on the day of the Hackathon
- Make sure you have current Python libraries installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Make sure you have Visual Studio Code or similar tool installed: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Make sure you have Streamlit or similar library for UI installed: https://streamlit.io/
- Create a .csv uploader to your AI model using these tools
- Upload a test .csv file from Biosphere 2
- Use your local AI model to interpret the .csv data
- Break ground in the development of a communication protocol that will allow your AI to communicate port-to-port with other Hack AZ AIs and the powerful Biosphere 2 reasoning model running in the cloud.

### ULTIMATE CHALLENGE QUEST!! Connect to the comprehensive Biosphere 2 data and discover useful scientific (and creative) applications:    https://biosphere2.org/research/systems-data
